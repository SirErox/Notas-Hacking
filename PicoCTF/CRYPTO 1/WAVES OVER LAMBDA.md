CONGRATS HERE IS YOUR FLAG - FREQUENCY_IS_C_OVER_LAMBDA_DNVTFRTAYU ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BETWEEN US THERE WAS, AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID SOMEWHERE, THE BOND OF THE SEA. BESIDES HOLDING OUR HEARTS TOGETHER THROUGH LONG PERIODS OF SEPARATION, IT HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING US TOLERANT OF EACH OTHER'S YARNSAND EVEN CONVICTIONS. THE LAWYERTHE BEST OF OLD FELLOWSHAD, BECAUSE OF HIS MANY YEARS AND MANY VIRTUES, THE ONLY CUSHION ON DECK, AND WAS LYING ON THE ONLY RUG. THE ACCOUNTANT HAD BROUGHT OUT ALREADY A BOX OF DOMINOES, AND WAS TOYING ARCHITECTURALLY WITH THE BONES. MARLOW SAT CROSS-LEGGED RIGHT AFT, LEANING AGAINST THE MIZZEN-MAST. HE HAD SUNKEN CHEEKS, A YELLOW COMPLEXION, A STRAIGHT BACK, AN ASCETIC ASPECT, AND, WITH HIS ARMS DROPPED, THE PALMS OF HANDS OUTWARDS, RESEMBLED AN IDOL. THE DIRECTOR, SATISFIED THE ANCHOR HAD GOOD HOLD, MADE HIS WAY AFT AND SAT DOWN AMONGST US. WE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS LAZILY. AFTERWARDS THERE WAS SILENCE ON BOARD THE YACHT. FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER WE DID NOT BEGIN THAT GAME OF DOMINOES. WE FELT MEDITATIVE, AND FIT FOR NOTHING BUT PLACID STARING. THE DAY WAS ENDING IN A SERENITY OF STILL AND EXQUISITE BRILLIANCE. THE WATER SHONE PACIFICALLY; THE SKY, WITHOUT A SPECK, WAS A BENIGN IMMENSITY OF UNSTAINED LIGHT; THE VERY MIST ON THE ESSEX MARSH WAS LIKE A GAUZY AND RADIANT FABRIC, HUNG FROM THE WOODED RISES INLAND, AND DRAPING THE LOW SHORES IN DIAPHANOUS FOLDS. ONLY THE GLOOM TO THE WEST, BROODING OVER THE UPPER REACHES, BECAME MORE SOMBRE EVERY MINUTE, AS IF ANGERED BY THE APPROACH OF THE SUN.
